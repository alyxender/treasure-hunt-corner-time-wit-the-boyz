# React Treasure Hunt

Hello! Welcome to our Treasure Hunt game! We created this Reactjs project for LEARN Academy, week 3 Alpha 2020 class. Feel free to check out our code, recreate or even improve our game! Below is all of the information you need to navigate through our project. Thank you.

## Installation

This project was created in ReactJs, and with that, a lot of repos are required to run it. In order to make this project not have a massive file size, we've excluded those packages.  But, we've included the installation information below.

## HOW DO I MAKE THIS WORK HALP

First up, you'll need to clone the project over to your local environment. This should be a simple process, however just incase, heres some basic commands to get 'er done.

1. Grab the URL from Github
2. Create a directory you can easily access on your computer that we will clone into.
3. Open your command prompt
4. Run the following command

```Bash
git clone <url here>
```

Next, you'll need to install the React repo's into the directory.

1. cd into your newly created clone directory.
2. Run the following command inside of the directory from your command line

```Bash
yarn
```

Give it a few minutes as it installs the repos. Once it has done this, you should be ready to run React and see the magic happen!

Type the following code:

```Bash
yarn start
```

Enjoy!

## Remember:
- Pseudocode!!
- Ask clarifying questions

## User Stories
- As a player, I can see a web page with a 3 by 3 grid board game with question marks in each square
- As a player, when I click on one of the question marks, an alert appears with the id of the position in the grid
- As a player, when I click on one of the question marks, instead of the alert the space turns into a tree icon (In order to focus on the functionality of this step, you can start with switching the ‘?’ to the word ‘tree’)
- As a player, I can click on the question marks and behind one of the question marks is a treasure box icon and an alert appears with the text “You Win”
- As a player, I can see a counter that shows how many guesses I have left (starting at 9, 8, 7, etc)
- As a player, I can see a “win” or “lose” message when the game is won or lost
- As a player, I can click on a “Play Again” button to restart the game

## Stretch
- As a player, I can click on the question marks and behind one of the question marks is a bomb icon and an alert appears with the text “You Lose"
- As a player, I can play a 25 square game with three bombs
